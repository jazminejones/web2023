        <p>Here at Jones Doggy Daycare and Grooming, INC. we do not over charge for boarding,
          grooming or daycare needs. We do ask that you pack your own food since some dogs and cats 
          have sensitive tummies. We also ask to bring a leash, in case all of ours are being used.
          
          
          When we first decided to open
        Doggy Daycare and Grooming, INC. we knew that people like us wanted someone
        who would treat our dogs like their own. Thus began this wonderful journey.
      </p> 

        <p>Jones Doggy Daycare and Grooming, INC. makes sure your
          pups and kittens have the best time while their owners are away.
          We have play areas, as well as cameras for those owners
          who cannot leave their babies without checking in on them.

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>All pups and kittens must be fully vaccinated, and have a 
          monthly flea, tick, and heartworm medication regiment. We have 
          a in-house veterinarian, in case of any illness or issues that 
          might present. We also make sure to call the owners, in case of an\
          accidnet that cannot wait until pick-up time.</p>
