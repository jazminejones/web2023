        <p>Here at Jones Doggy Daycare and Grooming, INC. we do not over charge for boarding,
          grooming or daycare needs. We do ask that you pack your own food since some dogs and cats 
          have sensitive tummies. We also ask to bring a leash, in case all of ours are being used.
          
          
        When we first decided to open Jones Doggy Daycare and Grooming, INC. 
        we knew that people like us wanted someone
        who would treat our dogs like their own. Thus began this wonderful journey.
      </p>

          want to make sure their furry friends are well taken care of while they are away. 
          It's nice to hear that they offer play areas for both dogs and cats, as well as cameras 
          for concerned owners to check in on their pets. This can give pet owners peace of mind knowing 
          that their pets are in good hands and having fun while they are away. It's important to choose a 
          reputable and trustworthy pet care facility, and it seems like Jones Doggy Daycare and Grooming, INC. 
          is a good option for pet owners looking for such services.
